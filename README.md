# Playwright QA Automation Testing Fundamentals

## Project Overview

This project serves as a foundational understanding into QA automation testing using the Playwright framework. 
Developed as part of a comprehensive Udemy course, it aims to provide a solid understanding of Playwright's capabilities, enabling the creation of robust, efficient, and maintainable automated test solutions. 
The core objective was to move beyond manual testing by leveraging Playwright's advantages for reliable and scalable test automation.


## Key Learning Outcomes & Accomplishments

Through hands-on exercises and practical examples, this project solidified my understanding and proficiency in the following areas:

* **HTML Structure Comprehension:** Developed a simple "ClickMe" webpage from scratch to gain a fundamental understanding of HTML element structure, which is crucial for effective web element interaction.
* **Web Element Location Strategies:** Mastered various Playwright selector types for efficient and reliable web element identification, including:
    * Locating elements by `ID`.
    * Targeting elements using specific `attributes`.
    * Identifying elements via `class` names.
    * Finding elements based on their visible `text` content.
    * Utilizing combinations of these selectors for complex scenarios.
* **Playwright's Built-in Locators:** Gained expertise in using Playwright's recommended built-in locators, enhancing the robustness and readability of test scripts.
* **Playwright Assertions for Test Reliability:** Implemented a wide range of Playwright assertions to rigorously verify application states and ensure test reliability and accuracy.
* This was extensively practiced on the **Herokuapp Internet website: (https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/)**.
* Specific assertions included:
    * Asserting element `visibility`.
    * Verifying `exact text match`.
    * Checking if an element `contains text`.
    * Asserting the `count` of elements.
    * Validating `checked` states of checkboxes/radio buttons.
    * Confirming `element value` for input fields.
    * Asserting `element enabled` status.
    * Verifying `text stored` within elements.
* **Page Object Model (POM) Implementation:** Designed and implemented the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern, leading to the creation of reusable, maintainable, and highly organized test codebases.
* This significantly improves test structure and reduces duplication.
* **API Testing with Playwright:** Extended testing capabilities to the backend by conducting API tests with Playwright.
* This involved verifying backend endpoints and ensuring seamless data integration and communication with the frontend.
* A key aspect of this learning was to **cross-verify API responses using Postman**, confirming the accuracy of both Postman and Playwright terminal outputs in VS Code for comprehensive validation.
* **Playwright Codegen Utilization:** Gained practical experience in reading and manually refining tests generated by Playwright Codegen, understanding how to leverage this tool for rapid test creation while maintaining code quality.


## Technologies and Skills Utilized

* **Playwright Framework:** Core automation framework for web and API testing.
* **JavaScript (for Playwright):** The primary programming language used for writing test scripts.
* **Postman:** Used for manual API testing and validation of API responses.
* **HTML:** Fundamental understanding of web page structure for element identification.
* **CSS Selectors / XPath:** Used for advanced web element location strategies.
* **Software Testing Principles:** Applied concepts of functional testing, assertion validation, and test design.
* **Test Automation Best Practices:** Implemented practices like modularity (POM) and reusability to build scalable test suites.
